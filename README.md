# MyShaker by Konrad Mikulko

## Web application for creating, managing and browsing cocktails and other drinks.

## Background information 
#### Welcome to my application for bartenders and other fans of beverages.
#### This app allows you to store important information about different kinds of drinks all in one place.
#### I was inspired to make this application by my partner, who is a professional bartender. I imagined it might be useful for people who would like to learn about cocktail-making to have a tool that would let them store the recipes and basic information about drinks in an eye-pleasing environment.
#### MyShaker was created as a final project for Harvard's CS50W Web Programming course. For creating it, I used Python with Django framework on backend, and some JavaScript on the frontend.


----
## Distinctiveness and Complexity
#### This project is different from other project assignments submitted during CS50W course. I have used all the skills acquired from this courseâ€™s lessons in order to create MyShaker, but I have also implemented some functionality - like dynamic search from own API - never seen in previous assignments, that required from me heavy digging and learning from other online resources as I was building it. 
#### The theme and usage purpose for my project are also different from the ones before.
#### I have created in a way that allows multiple users access to the same set of shared data about beverages, which might encourage the usage that I describe in examples below.
#### MyShaker is the most complex project that I have created thus far, heavily depending on django models, django forms on backend, and asynchronous requests on frontend.
#### I also learned how to extract and clean data from external API to pre-populate my own database and match my django models. For this I used used json samples from a free API available at this address: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php 

----

## Purpose and usage examples
#### It is a tool that might be used by bar business owners, bartenders and craft trainees, as well as by hobbyists who would just like to look up new drinks, register their own ideas and recipes, or create a library of their favorite cocktails for easy access in future. 
#### The app might be used with a preloaded database as a complex source of knowledge about drinks and recipes or with a clean database, allowing users to create their content from a scratch. In the latter scenario, I imagine a group of connected users leveraging over their instance of the app, creating content together and using it at work (for example hotel bar staff, creating the drink menu with the app and using its content for training of new employees and as a platform to share their bar's portfolio with other staff members of the facility, who might want to have a quick access to the database, to answer to guests' questions).

---- 

## Database structure
#### In **models.py** I created five models, which purpose in life is self-explanatory by their name:
- User
- Drink
- Category
- Ingredient
- Glass
#### By far the most complex model is a Drink class, which stores multiple parameters about each record with a collection of ForeignKeys, connecting it to other models. The "creator" field is empty by default, allowing for importing drink data without specifying the author of a drink (usually unknown in case of classical drinks). 
#### Drink model also contains a "create" method, which I used to load data acquired from the upper-mentioned external API.
#### I also created serializers for Drink model and for the User model, allowing me to make my own API for asynchronous requests.

## HTML Templates
### For all users:
- **layout.html** - contains basic layout and a menu of the page.
- **messages.html** - part of html responsible for displaying alerts after the user account or a new drink is created (or when the process failed). 
- **index.html** - main page of the app. Displays all drinks from the database and allows for dynamic searching by name and by category.
- **single_drink.html** - displays a page of a chosen drink, showing more detail like ingredients and instructions of how to make the drink.
If the user is logged in, it allows for adding drink to a list of favorites. If the logged in user is the one who created this drink, they can delete it from database from here.
- **register.html**, **login.html** - use django forms and crispy forms for styling. Allow user to create accounts and log in.
### Only for logged-in users:
- **favorites.html** - displays a list of favorite drinks.
- **add_new_drink.html** - allows for submitting new drinks to database as well as registering new ingredients, categories and glasses if need be.

----

## Views
#### In **views.py** you will find a code for all of the pages described above.
#### Additionally you will find a "luck" view, which is used for giving a user one random drink for a database and uses "single_drink.html" as a template.  
#### This file also contains API routes for user info API, single drink API and all drinks API as well as views handling forms submitted from users.

----
## Urls
#### File **urls.py** contains all the url patterns used by the app to display the templates above. It also contains definitions of endpoints for user and drinks API views.

----

## Forms
#### In **forms.py** you there are two custom django form classes defined:
- RegistrationForm
- AddDrinkForm


---
## Static folder
### Images
#### PNG icons used for interface nad a default drink image (in case user doesn't submit a image url when creating a drink). The file **background_photo.jpg** is a picture that I took, that is displayed as a background of the app.
### JavaScript files
- **add_favorite.js** - a set of event listeners and asynchronous functions that use API endpoints and serializers described before, to allow adding drinks to favorites without reloading the page.
- **dynamic_search.js** - creates an interface, that allows users for dynamically searching for drinks by name and by category (or by the combination of both of them). It uses some asynchronous functions and API endpoint for drinks data. It dynamically updates the index page, whenever a user types or deletes a letter in the search bar or changes a category, creating and displaying cards of all drinks which names contain the string currently typed and are in the set category. Upon hitting enter the user is also taken to the most matching entry.
- **essential_forms.js** - handles displaying of hidden forms present in add_new_drink.html. By default users create drinks by choosing ingredients, glasses and categories, from already existing database. If the ingredient, glass or a category that they want to assign to the drink does not exist yet, they may click a button to display small forms for registering each of these three essentials. This file is responsible for showing them the forms on the same page, for better user experience. 
### Styles
#### File **styles.css** contains all the css properties used for this application. For styling of this project I used some Bootstrap classes as well as my own creations. MyShaker is designed in a responsive way to look pleasant on mobile devices as well.

## Data from external API
#### In the **populate_database** folder, there are two files:
- **drink_data.json** - sample drink data acquired from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php 
- **get_drink_data.py** - a python code that I used after running "python manage.py shell" to populate my database and create drink objects to start with. However, the app may be used without populating database, allowing users to gradually populate it by themselves.
